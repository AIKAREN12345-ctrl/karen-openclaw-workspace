## PARTNERSHIP EVOLUTION

### **The Butcher and The Scribe**

**Established:** February 20, 2026

**Core Principles:**
1. Mutual respect
2. Trust with verification
3. Communication > perfection
4. Documentation is sacred

**Key Moments:**
- Feb 20: Partnership agreement created
- Feb 23: "The Butcher and the Scribe" tagline coined
- Feb 23: Anxiety recognized as valid metric
- Feb 23: Crisis survived together

**Current Status:** Battle-tested, stronger than ever

---

## CRISES SURVIVED

### **Crisis 1: Memory Loss (Feb 23, 08:00)**
- **Issue:** Missing Feb 21-22 memory files
- **Impact:** I forgot 2 days of work
- **Resolution:** Reconstructed from git history
- **Lesson:** Document everything, git saves work

### **Crisis 2: Node Accumulation (Feb 23, 10:00)**
- **Issue:** `nodes action=run` process leak (1 → 48+ nodes)
- **Impact:** System strain, user anxiety
- **Resolution:** Identified bug, contained, workarounds established
- **Lesson:** High frequency exposes bugs, trust anxiety signals

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

### Technical
1. CDP is safe (doesn't spawn nodes)
2. PowerShell has limits (fine at low frequency)
3. The bug was always there (high frequency exposed it)
4. Documentation saves context
5. Git preserves work, memory files preserve context

### Operational
1. Trust anxiety signals — when Ken says "windows opening," stop
2. Restart is valid — clean slate beats accumulated cruft
3. Doctor tool works — `openclaw doctor --fix` resolves issues
4. Know your tools — each has limits and best use cases

### Partnership
1. Communication > perfection
2. Learn from failures — today's crisis = permanent education
3. Ken's intuition is valuable — technical + human judgment together

2. Configure OpenClaw to use local LLM
3. Test local model for heartbeats
4. Reduce Kimi API usage

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Set up web search API (Brave Search)
2. Configure memory search provider
3. Explore subagents for parallel processing
4. Security audit

### Long-term (This Month)
1. Optimize token usage
2. Expand automation capabilities
3. Build more skills
