### VNC Calibration System — MAJOR MILESTONE
This was huge. We built the entire VNC infrastructure:

- vnc-screenshot.py (multiple variants)
- vnc-controller.py — mouse/keyboard control
- karen-vnc-service.py — background service
- ultravnc-screenshot.py — UltraVNC integration
- test-vnc-*.py — various test scripts

**Status:** VNC system operational!
