## 08:40 - PENDING: OpenClaw Restart Required

**Status:** Browser CDP port changed from 18792 → 18793 in config
**Action Required:** Restart OpenClaw gateway to apply changes
**Blocked By:** Port 18792 still in use, causing browser snapshot failures

**After Restart:**
- Browser should use port 18793
- Browser snapshots should work
- Can then test VNC recording capability

**User:** Will restart gateway when ready
**Karen:** Standing by
