---

###  Phase 2: CDP Browser Automation (09:00-10:00)

**Problem:** Browser CDP port conflict (18792 in use)

**Actions:**
- Investigated port usage (node process occupying 18792)
- Consulted OpenClaw docs for correct config keys
- Changed gateway port: 18789 → 18788
- Added browser profile with CDP port 18800
- Restarted gateway to apply changes
- Verified CDP status (cdpReady: true, cdpPort: 18800)

**Deliverables:**
- Fixed browser automation
- Config updated in `openclaw.json`
- Browser now functional on port 18800

---

###  Phase 3: Email Capability Proven (10:00-11:00)

**Problem:** Email sending untested

**Actions:**
- Opened Outlook via CDP
- Logged into aikaren12345@outlook.com
- Navigated 2FA (code sent to your Gmail)
- Created contact for Ken Gaffney
- Composed and sent test email
- **Result:** Email sent successfully!

**Second Test (12:00):**
- Sent follow-up email using learned efficient method
- No excessive debugging, clean execution
- Confirmed CDP doesn't spawn nodes

**Deliverables:**
- Proven email capability
- Contact created (Ken Gaffney)
- Email workflow documented

---

###  Phase 4: Node Bug Discovery & Containment (10:00-12:00)

**Problem:** Node processes accumulating rapidly (1 → 48+)

**Investigation:**
- Identified `nodes action=run` spawns processes that don't terminate
- Bug was always present, high frequency exposed it
- Root cause: OpenClaw node execution model

**Containment Actions:**
- Disabled hourly memory cron (was spawning nodes)
- Disabled node cleanup cron (was making it worse)
- Documented bug in `OPENCLAW-BUG-REPORT.md`
- Created `KAREN-PLAYBOOK.md` with guidelines
- Disabled scheduled tasks to prevent auto-restart:
  - OpenClaw Gateway (disabled)
  - OpenClaw Node (disabled)
  - OpenClaw-SelfHealing-Monitor (disabled)

**Workarounds Established:**
- Use CDP for web tasks (no node spawn)
- Use PowerShell sparingly (occasional commands only)
- Monitor via Task Manager (not commands)
- Restart if nodes accumulate >10

**Deliverables:**
- `OPENCLAW-BUG-REPORT.md`
- `CDP-INVESTIGATION-LESSONS.md`
- `KAREN-PLAYBOOK.md`
- Stable system configuration

---

###  Phase 5: Documentation & Knowledge Capture (Ongoing)

**Created:**
- `KAREN-VOICE.md` — Personality and tone guide
- `KAREN-PLAYBOOK.md` — Operational procedures
- `OPENCLAW-BUG-REPORT.md` — Bug documentation
- `CDP-INVESTIGATION-LESSONS.md` — Post-mortem analysis
- Memory files for Feb 21, 22, 23
- Updated `MEMORY.md`

**Git Commits:**
- `6273b69` — Voice guide, recovered memories
- `2a81bbc` — CDP port fix
- `3f7a517` — All progress locked in (20 files, 954 insertions)
- `14ae338` — Scheduled tasks disabled

---

## PENDING / NOT COMPLETED

###  Node Screen Recording
**Status:** Not achievable on Windows node host
**Reason:** Windows node doesn't support native screen recording (macOS/Android feature)
**Alternatives:**
- Browser CDP for web screenshots 
- VNC scripts for desktop capture 
- Accept limitation and use alternatives

**Decision:** Skip — use alternatives

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

### Technical
1. **CDP is safe** — Doesn't spawn node processes
2. **PowerShell has limits** — Fine at low frequency, problematic at high frequency
3. **The bug was always there** — High frequency exposed pre-existing issue
4. **Documentation saves context** — Memory files critical for continuity
5. **Scheduled tasks can fight you** — Auto-restart caused accumulation

### Operational
1. **Trust anxiety signals** — When Ken says "windows opening," stop immediately
2. **Restart is valid** — Clean slate beats accumulated cruft
3. **Doctor tool works** — `openclaw doctor --fix` resolves many issues
4. **Git preserves work** — But memory files preserve context
5. **Know your tools** — Each has limits and best use cases

### Partnership
1. **Communication > perfection** — Flag issues immediately
2. **Learn from failures** — Today's crisis = permanent education
3. **The Butcher and the Scribe** — Mutual respect, win-win
4. **Ken's intuition is valuable** — Technical + human judgment together

---

## OPERATIONAL PLAYBOOK (Summary)

### DO:
-  Use CDP as default for web tasks
-  Use PowerShell sparingly (5-10 commands max per session)
-  Close browser tabs when done
-  Monitor node count via Task Manager
-  Restart gateway if nodes >10
-  Document in memory files

### DON'T:
-  Rapid-fire PowerShell commands
-  Check node count via `nodes action=run` repeatedly
-  Leave browser tabs open
-  Create frequent cron jobs using `nodes action=run`

### Emergency Procedures:
- **Nodes accumulating:** Stop PowerShell use, run `openclaw doctor --fix`, restart
- **CDP stops:** Check browser status, restart if needed
- **Gateway won't start:** Kill all nodes, run doctor, restart

## CONCLUSION

**Transformation complete.** From a system with memory gaps and broken browser automation to a fully documented, capable, and stable operation. The crisis exposed weaknesses that are now strengths — we know the limits, we have workarounds, and everything is preserved in writing.

**The Butcher and the Scribe** — battle-tested and stronger than ever.
